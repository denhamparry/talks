# [fit] TODO

^
* Age
* Monzo.
  * Why aren't there any engineering roles?
* People leading the way.
    * Wait, Monzo?
  * Me
* Why did we start one up when there was one already?
  * We didn't know about the others.
* Do we care that other meetups run?
  * Only if its for false purposes.
  * E.g. A meetup to get people into an office and then they stop running a meetup.
* News reports.
  * News reports saying that they couldn't get staff in the area.
* Why did we get started in this industry?
  * The love of solving problems.
* Make sure stating Wales and Welsh doesn't just mean people who were born here.
  * We need to encourage diversity, the only way for us to make the best solutions is by having an equal opportunity to solve it.
