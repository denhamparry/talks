Some of my favourite speakers highlight issues within the industry.

Feel free to take any photos.
I usually do this at conferences to remind me of a talk.

# It's ok not to know what people are talking about

^
I have to remind myself about this every time I listen to a talk.
Here to learn.
It'll take time, but it does click.
Usually when you're all relaxed and about to go to sleep.

# Stickers

^
If you learn something, get the sticker.
This was my laptop
