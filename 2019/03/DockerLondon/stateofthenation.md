Is this going to happen?
Do we avoid the great divide.
Will there be new things from Windows.

---

# Onboarding

^
- Organisations I worked for were Windows 8.
- They had Windows Server 2012.

---

# Confusion

^
- Windows 10 is container ready.
- Windows Server 2106 is container ready.
- Windows Server 2019 is Kubernetes ready.

---

# Hypervisor issue
^
- Docker for Windows still uses a Linux VM to run Linux containers.
- Docker Toolbox was using a Virtual Box.
- Linux VM is run using Hyper-V - a Windows-native hypervisor.
- This means that Docker for Windows ships fewer components and has less moving parts.
