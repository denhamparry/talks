## TODO: Swiss Cheese Model Diagram

This directory should contain a Swiss cheese model diagram illustrating defense in depth:

- Filename: `swiss-cheese-model.png`
- Content: Multiple layers (slices) with holes that occasionally align
- Visual metaphor: Why multiple security layers are necessary
- Each slice represents a security control (firewall, scanning, monitoring, runtime security)
- Holes represent vulnerabilities or weaknesses in each control

**Resources for creating the diagram:**
- James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model (original concept)
- Example images: Search for "swiss cheese security model"
- Tools: Draw.io, Figma, or similar diagram tools

Until the diagram is created, the presentation will use a text-based explanation of the concept.
