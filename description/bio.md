Lewis is a Solutions Engineer at Jetstack (@jetstackhq), a company that's focused on everything Kubernetes.  You'll find him running workshops around the world helping people get started on their Cloud Native journey as well as setting War Games to test peoples skills.

Before lifting and shifting himself to the Cloud, Lewis worked as a .Net developer in the Financial sector.  He created a startup in his Dad's garage and was lucky enough to travel around the world solving lots of different problems and sometimes making some more.

He co-founded Cloud Native Wales, an initiative to help people learn Cloud Native technologies and establish a community to support each other.

When he's not playing with tech, he's busy trying to find where his Son is hiding, getting taken for a walk by his dog and spending as much time as possible with his friends and family (preferably on a ski slope).

Feel free to message Lewis @denhamparry and he'll probably send you a message back, filled with emojis ✌️👨‍🚀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
